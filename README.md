Zedit is a helper widget for [Fyne](https://fyne.io) to implement an efficient single-font text editor with syntax coloring. ***This package is in alpha stage and not yet usable.*** It contains many hacks and changes a lot. If you find it interesting, you need to wait for a release. However, please feel free to study the source code and let me know if you find a bug.
